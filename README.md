DarkRP Vending Machine v3.3
=======

DarkRP Vending Machine for Garry's Mod 13 DarkRP 2.7+

The Vending Machine is just as it sounds. It's a functioning vending machine that gives you soda in exchange for DarkRP money. There is a full configuration to control what the vending machine gives you from health, energy, armor and more.

I highly recommend downloading latest release. New version 3.3 has not been properly tested.
